## ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tips**

1. **Test in isolation**: Test each change independently
2. **Use different environments**: Test on different machines/OS
3. **Document as you go**: Update docs while making changes
4. **Automate what you can**: Add scripts for repetitive tasks
5. **Plan for rollback**: Always have a way to revert changes

**Remember**: This checklist is a living document. Update it as you discover new requirements or edge cases!
