# 🔍 Dependency Analyzer Project

> **Smart commit filtering for better changelog quality and accurate version bumping**

## 📋 Project Description

**Problem**: Our version management system uses basic file filtering, leading to irrelevant commits in changelogs and inaccurate version bumping.

**Solution**: Implement intelligent commit filtering that analyzes package dependencies to show only relevant commits in changelogs and make better version bump decisions.

**Business Value**: Cleaner changelogs, more accurate versioning, better developer experience.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

| Criteria | Status | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Dependency Analysis** | ✅ Complete | Correctly identifies package dependencies |
| **Commit Filtering** | ✅ Complete | Only relevant commits appear in changelogs |
| **Cross-Package Impact** | ✅ Complete | Changes to dependencies trigger version bumps |
| **Historical Analysis** | ✅ Complete | Works with historical tags and commits |
| **Performance** | ✅ Complete | Executes in < 5 seconds per package |
| **Error Handling** | ✅ Complete | Graceful handling of invalid inputs |
| **Script Compatibility** | ✅ Complete | All existing scripts work unchanged |

## 📊 Project Status

**Overall**: ✅ **COMPLETED** *(Exceeded Expectations)*

**Timeline**: 5 weeks (1 week ahead of schedule)  
**Quality**: Better architecture than originally planned  
**Performance**: No degradation, actually improved

## 🧪 How to Test

**Basic Functionality**: Run `version-prepare` on any package and verify it only shows commits relevant to that package and its dependencies.

**Cross-Package Impact**: Make changes to a dependency package (like utils), then run `version-prepare` on a package that depends on it (like UI). The dependent package should include the dependency changes in its changelog.

**Version Bumping**: Make breaking changes to a package and verify it gets a major version bump. Then check that packages depending on it get appropriate minor/patch bumps.

**Performance**: Run `version-prepare` with large commit ranges and verify it completes in reasonable time (< 5 seconds per package).

**Error Handling**: Try running with invalid package names or tags and verify it shows clear error messages instead of crashing.
