### CI/CD Utilities
- `bun run ci:act` - Run GitHub Actions locally

### Storybook
- `bun run build:storybook` - Build Storybook for all UI packages

### Single Package Development
Use bun run with turbo filtering for working on specific packages:
- `bun run build --filter=@repo/ui` - Build only the UI package
- `bun run test --filter=packages/intershell` - Test only the intershell package
- `bun run dev --filter=apps/admin` - Run only the admin app

## Architecture Overview

This is a **Turborepo monorepo** using **Bun** as the package manager and runtime, designed with entity-driven architecture and CLI tooling.

### Package Structure
- **`packages/`** - Shared packages and libraries
  - `intershell` - Custom CLI framework with entity-driven architecture for monorepo control
  - `ui` - Shared React component library with Storybook (port 3004)
  - `utils` - Shared utility functions
  - `typescript-config` - Shared TypeScript configurations
  - `test-preset` - Shared testing configurations and mocks

- **`apps/`** - Applications
  - `admin` - React + Vite admin dashboard (port 3001)
  - `storefront` - Next.js e-commerce frontend (port 3002)
  - `api` - Express + TypeScript backend API (port 3003)
  - `docs-astro` - Astro documentation site

### Key Technologies
- **Build System**: Turborepo with Bun package manager
- **Frontend**: React 19, Next.js 15, Astro, Svelte
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, CSS modules
- **Testing**: Bun test runner with custom test presets
- **Code Quality**: Biome for linting/formatting
- **Containers**: Docker with DevContainer support
- **Git Hooks**: Lefthook for pre-commit automation

### InterShell CLI Framework
The repository uses a custom CLI framework called **InterShell** located in `packages/intershell/`. This provides:
- Entity-driven architecture for managing monorepo components
- Advanced CLI tooling with validation and automation
- Automated scripting for complex development workflows
- Configuration through `i.config.ts` in the root

**Note**: The interactive page-based navigation system is currently in development - the framework currently focuses on entity-based operations and automated scripting.

### Current InterShell Features (Production Ready)
The InterShell system provides comprehensive entity-based functionality:
- **Staged File Checking**: Comprehensive validation of staged files with configurable rules
- **Branch Linting**: Advanced branch name validation and enforcement
- **Version Bump Automation**: Intelligent version management based on commit analysis
- **Changelog Auto-Generation**: Comprehensive changelog creation with PR integration
- **Dependency Analyzer**: Smart commit filtering based on package dependencies
- **Cross-Package Impact Detection**: Changes to dependencies trigger appropriate version bumps
- **Enhanced Changelog Quality**: Only relevant commits appear in changelogs

### Development Workflow
1. **Docker-First**: Recommended to use DevContainer for consistent environment
2. **Entity-Driven**: Use InterShell entities for managing packages, branches, commits, etc.
3. **Quality Gates**: All code goes through Biome linting, TypeScript checking, and testing
4. **Automation**: Git hooks handle commit formatting, version management, and changelog generation

### TypeScript Configuration
- Strict TypeScript with explicit return types required
- No `any` types allowed - use proper typing with type guards
- Interface definitions required for all data structures
- Import organization: React â†’ Third-party â†’ Local (absolute) â†’ Relative

### Testing Conventions
- Use Bun test runner with custom test presets from `packages/test-preset`
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Create reusable test utilities and mock factories
- Group tests logically with descriptive `describe` blocks

### Security Guidelines
- All user input must be validated and sanitized
- Environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- JWT tokens for authentication with refresh mechanisms
- CORS properly configured for allowed origins

### Component Development
- Functional components with TypeScript interfaces
- Custom hooks for reusable logic
- Consistent import/export organization
- Props interfaces with explicit typing
