## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

#### **Bun Not Found**
```bash
# If bun command is not found, add to PATH
export PATH="$HOME/.bun/bin:$PATH"

# Or restart your terminal after installation
# On macOS/Linux, the installer should add this automatically
```

#### **Bun Installation Fails**
```bash
# Try alternative installation methods
npm install -g bun

# Or use Homebrew (macOS)
brew tap oven-sh/bun
brew install bun

# Check system requirements
# Bun requires macOS 10.15+, Linux, or Windows 10+
```

#### **Docker Not Running**
```bash
# Start Docker Desktop
# On macOS/Linux: sudo systemctl start docker
# On Windows: Start Docker Desktop application
```

#### **DevContainer Build Fails**
```bash
# Clean up and retry
bun run local:cleanup
bun run dev:rm
# Then reopen in DevContainer
```

#### **Port Conflicts**
```bash
# Check what's using the ports
lsof -i :3001
lsof -i :3002
lsof -i :3003
lsof -i :3003

# Kill conflicting processes or change ports in docker-compose.dev.yml
```

#### **Permission Issues**
```bash
# Fix Docker permissions (Linux/macOS)
sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

#### **VS Code Extensions Not Syncing**
